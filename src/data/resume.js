    summary: ["Hi, I’m Usha — a software engineering and integration specialist with more than 10 years of experience building enterprise-scale solutions across the .NET and Azure ecosystem. My career has been shaped by a deep curiosity for how systems work behind the scenes and a passion for creating clean, reliable, and scalable technology that makes a real difference for users and businesses.\n\n",
        "I’ve spent the last decade designing backend architectures, modernizing legacy systems, and building high-throughput APIs that power critical workflows for millions of users. Whether it’s crafting robust .NET Core services, optimizing SQL performance, engineering complex XML/XSLT transformations, or automating deployments through Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions, I focus on creating systems that are stable, secure, and built to last.\n\n",
        "What motivates me most is solving complex integration challenges—connecting legacy platforms, cloud services, and third-party systems through well-designed APIs and resilient data flows. I enjoy diving into production issues, uncovering root causes, and delivering solutions that improve reliability and reduce operational friction.\n\n",
        "I also bring strong leadership experience, having guided teams through Agile delivery, mentored developers, defined API contracts, and partnered with architects and product owners to shape technical strategies. I believe in building software with clarity, collaboration, and a deep respect for both engineering and business outcomes.\n\n",
        "Outside of the code itself, I value continuous learning. Earning certifications like Azure Administrator, Azure Solutions Architect Expert, and ScrumMaster has helped me stay ahead in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.\n\nEvery project I take on reflects the same principles: thoughtful design, seamless integration, and technology that supports meaningful impact. Welcome to my portfolio—I’m glad you’re here.\n\n"
